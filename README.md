**README for the "Business Manager" program.**
This is a demo project not intended for actual usage. It was originally created in 2016 as an experiment for the capabilities and limitations of Tkinter's appJar dependency (for Python). It should work without problem (on both Windows & MacOS)as long as you have Python installed.


**Requirements:**
1. Ability to read. You can download it at https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2501830659.
2. Tkinter & appJar must be installed. It comes bundled with the program, but you can download it at http://appjar.info/Install/.
3. Python must be installed. The latest version is recommended. You can download it at https://www.python.org/downloads/.


**How to run program? Either:**
- Launch the BusinessManager.exe file (icons disabled)


OR

- Launch it through Python as you would any other .py file.


**Program doesn't work as intended? Either:**
- try BusinessManagerLegacy.py


OR

- Give up, cause it will NOT be fixed.
